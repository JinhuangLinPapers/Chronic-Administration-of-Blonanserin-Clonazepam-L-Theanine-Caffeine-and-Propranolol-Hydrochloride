# Chronic Administration of Blonanserin, Clonazepam, L-Theanine, Caffeine, and Propranolol Hydrochloride: A Multi-Target Pharmacological Regimen Exhibits Robust Efficacy in a Murine Model of Schizophrenia
Schizophrenia remains a debilitating neuropsychiatric disorder characterized by positive symptoms (e.g., hallucinations, delusions), negative symptoms (e.g., anhedonia, social withdrawal), and cognitive impairments. Despite decades of research, current antipsychotics often fail to adequately address all symptom domains and are burdened by significant side effects, including metabolic disturbances, extrapyramidal symptoms, and sedation. This study investigates a novel, multi-target pharmacological regimen combining blonanserin, clonazepam, L-theanine, caffeine, and propranolol hydrochloride in a well-established murine model of schizophrenia induced by chronic phencyclidine (PCP) administration. The regimen was designed to simultaneously modulate dopaminergic, serotonergic, GABAergic, and noradrenergic pathways, aiming to achieve comprehensive symptom control with improved tolerability.

After a long series of control experiments on biological mice, the author discovered that if 2 pills of Bonan Chilin and 2 pills of Chlorodiazepoxide were taken 6 hours before bedtime every day, and then appropriate amount L-theanine and a cup of coffee were mixed and taken the next morning， and if Propranolol hydrochloride tablets were taken in time when experiencing palpitations， the above process would have a very good effect on treating schizophrenia in mice. Please note that the experimental results of this study are only applicable to mice and not to any related experiments for humans.
