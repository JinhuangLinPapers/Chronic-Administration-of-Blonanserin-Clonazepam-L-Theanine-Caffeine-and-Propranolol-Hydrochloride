# Chronic Administration of Blonanserin, Clonazepam, L-Theanine, Caffeine, and Propranolol Hydrochloride: A Multi-Target Pharmacological Regimen Exhibits Robust Efficacy in a Murine Model of Schizophrenia
Schizophrenia remains a debilitating neuropsychiatric disorder characterized by positive symptoms (e.g., hallucinations, delusions), negative symptoms (e.g., anhedonia, social withdrawal), and cognitive impairments. Despite decades of research, current antipsychotics often fail to adequately address all symptom domains and are burdened by significant side effects, including metabolic disturbances, extrapyramidal symptoms, and sedation. This study investigates a novel, multi-target pharmacological regimen combining blonanserin, clonazepam, L-theanine, caffeine, and propranolol hydrochloride in a well-established murine model of schizophrenia induced by chronic phencyclidine (PCP) administration. The regimen was designed to simultaneously modulate dopaminergic, serotonergic, GABAergic, and noradrenergic pathways, aiming to achieve comprehensive symptom control with improved tolerability.
